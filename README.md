## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

osuTracker is a tool that tracks osu! statistics of any player who signs up. It also combines the players of every country to give custom country statistics such as the top 100 play history and top 10 players over time. Data is collected once a day; when it is collected, the most common beatmaps seen in profiles are counted up to find the most popular mapsets in the game which is used to track the farm percentage of each player. The API for osuTracker is public and has [full documentation](https://wiki.nzbasic.com/docs/osuTracker/aboutOsuTracker).

The key features of **osuTracker**:

- Tracking user stats
- Tracking country stats
- Allows any user to add themselves automatically 
- Tracking history of top 100 plays for each country (and global)
